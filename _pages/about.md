I'm a graduate student studying computer science at [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) under the co-supervision of 
[Gennady Pekhimenko](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pekhimenko/) and 
[Eyal de Lara](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delara/).

My research interests broadly cover GPU cloud computing, profiling and optimizing 
machine learning workloads, and mobile computing topics including on-device training and OS level security.

News:
======
* Open sourced [RL-Scope on github](https://github.com/UofT-EcoSystem/rlscope); profile your RL workloads today!
* Published RL-Scope at [MLSys 2021](https://mlsys.org/Conferences/2021/Schedule?showEvent=1517)!

======
* [Ecosystem](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/ecosystem/) - [Gennady Pekhimenko's](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pekhimenko/) 
  group focussed on systems and architecture approaches to accelerating emerging workloads such as machine learning.
